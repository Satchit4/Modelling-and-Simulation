The plug flow reactor model
(PFR, sometimes called continuous tubular reactor, CTR, or piston flow reactors) is a model used to describe chemical reactions
in continuous, flowing systems of cylindrical geometry. The PFR model is used to predict the behavior of chemical reactors of such design,
so that key reactor variables, such as the dimensions of the reactor, can be estimated.

Fluid going through a PFR may be modeled as flowing through the reactor as a series of infinitely thin coherent "plugs",
each with a uniform composition, traveling in the axial direction of the reactor, with each plug having a different composition from
the ones before and after it. The key assumption is that as a plug flows through a PFR, the fluid is perfectly mixed in the radial
direction but not in the axial direction (forwards or backwards). Each plug of differential volume is considered as a separate entity,
effectively an infinitesimally small continuous stirred tank reactor, limiting to zero volume. As it flows down the tubular PFR,
the residence time ( tau ) of the plug is a function of its position in the reactor. In the ideal PFR,
the residence time distribution is therefore a Dirac delta function with a value equal to tau .
